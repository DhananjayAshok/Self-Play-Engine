"""The contract every game implements.

A Game is the single source of truth: settings, state, rules, legality, transitions,
the end of the game and rewards. It never calls a model, never sees players' talk or
notes, and never decides who is asked first; the runner does those.

Division of labour:
    Game    -> WHO MAY act, WHAT is legal, what happens, and the prompt text.
    Runner  -> WHO IS ASKED FIRST, model calls, talk, thoughtpads, checkpoints, the record.

Actions are plain JSON values chosen by each game (a string, a dict, ...). The runner
never builds or inspects them: it passes a player's answer text to `parse_answer` and
the result to `step`.

Thinking: every game has THINKING phases, run by this base class. Each player's first
action is always `THINK`, and a game asks for more with `request_thinking`. In a thinking
turn the player rewrites its private thoughtpad (kept by the runner, never seen here);
the game only learns that the turn happened.

All mutable game state lives in `self.state`, a dict of JSON values. That is what makes
every game checkpointable without game-specific save code. Randomness during play is
derived from the seed (see `rng`), never kept as a live generator in the state.

Rewards come at two grains, both decided once the game is over: `get_outcome` gives each
player one reward for the game, and `get_step_rewards` gives each accepted step its own,
so a step can be credited by what it led to later.
