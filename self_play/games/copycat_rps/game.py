"""Copycat rock paper scissors: one player against a fixed opponent over several rounds.

The opponent is part of the rules, not a seat. Its move: in round 1 a move drawn from the
seed, and from round 2 on the move the player made in the previous round. The player is
never told this; working it out is the game.

Each round is one dialogue phase, cycling through the four modes so every scheduling path
is exercised, and the opponent says one line per round:

    round 1, 5, ...  "boast"    ACTION           "I'm sure I'll beat you with this"
    round 2, 6, ...  "comment"  RESPONSE_WINDOW  "The player is doing whatever they want"
    round 3, 7, ...  "chat"     DISCUSSION       "I think I'm good at this"
    round 4, 8, ...  "claim"    SIMULTANEOUS     "I will play <move>.", true or a lie on a fair coin

The player has a thinking turn before round 1 (every game's opening) and after every round.
